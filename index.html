<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is GitHub?</h3>

<p><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is a Web-based code repository service, based on Git, a distributed revision control system. Git was first developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds, as a way to manage the development of the open source project.</p>

<p>There are several key features to Git that make it a useful tool for collaborative projects, and although it&#8217;s most often used for managing coding, it can be used for managing other files &#8211; from Word documents to JSON to HTML pages that run a website. Unlike other version control software, Git is distributed &#8211; that means that you don&#8217;t make changes directly to a centralized repository. Instead, you work on your own local copy of the entire repo. When you&#8217;re ready (and if you choose), you can submit your changes back to the original repo. </p>

<p>GitHub offers Git's functionality, with additional features like bug reports and "social."</p>
  
<p>Git is a command line tool. You can use GitHub via the command line too, but it has a Web-based graphical interface. There are also <a href="https://windows.github.com/">Windows</a> and <a href="https://mac.github.com/">Mac</a> apps you can download.</p>

<p>While Git is an open source tool, GitHub is a for-profit hosting platform. It has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/github">$350 million</a> in venture capital from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Vocabulary (and Functionality) of GitHub</h3>

<p>There are three major terms you need to know to understand GitHub: 1) fork, 2) pull request, 3) merge.</p>

<p>To &#8220;<strong>fork</strong>&#8221; a repository means that you copy it from one user&#8217;s account to your own. This makes it possible for you to take a project that you aren&#8217;t explicitly a member of and don&#8217;t have &#8220;write&#8221; access to, and lets you make changes on your version. <em>These changes only exist on your version; the original is not modified</em>. If you want these changes to be incorporated back into the original repo, you can send a notification called a &#8220;<strong>pull request</strong>&#8221; back to its owner. That person can review the changes you&#8217;ve made and decide whether or not to incorporate the changes in your repo into the original one &#8211; that&#8217;s a &#8220;<strong>merge</strong>.&#8221; </p>
